# reference-remote-fields-stripe

> Query product and price data from [Stripe](https://stripe.com/docs/api) using GraphCMS [Remote Fields](https://graphcms.com/docs/schema/field-types#remote) ðŸ’³

## About

This reference is basic example of Content Federation, using Remote Fields to connect a `PricingPlan` type with third-party product and pricing data from Stripe. A common use case would be to enrich recurring or one-time Stripe products with data from GraphCMS (such as images or additional text content).

Built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com).

## Usage

> This assumes you have already created a GraphCMS project and have an existing Stripe account

1.  Build the required GraphCMS schema, including Remote Fields, using the Management SDK. [This example](https://github.com/GraphCMS/graphcms-examples/tree/master/using-management-sdk) was used to bootstrap this project.

2.  Populate your GraphCMS project with `PricingPlan` content entries. Be sure you to provide the relevant IDs (`stripeMonthlyPriceId`, `stripeAnnualPriceId`) for the Stripe prices created in your Stripe dashboard.

3.  Clone with repository with [`degit`](https://github.com/Rich-Harris/degit).

```bash
npx clone GraphCMS/reference-remote-fields-stripe
```

3. Clone the provided `.env.sample` and provide required variable values.

```
